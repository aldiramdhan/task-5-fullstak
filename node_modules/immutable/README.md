## Introduction

[Immutable][] data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler
application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization
and change detection techniques with simple logic. [Persistent][] data presents
a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always
yields new updated data.

Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including:
`List`, `Stack`, `Map`, `OrderedMap`, `Set`, `OrderedSet` and `Record`.

These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using
structural sharing via [hash maps tries][] and [vector tries][] as popularized
by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.

Immutable.js also provides a lazy `Seq`, allowing efficient
chaining of collection methods like `map` and `filter` without creating
intermediate representations. Create some `Seq` with `Range` and `Repeat`.

## Getting started

Install `immutable` using npm.

```shell
npm install immutable
```

Or install using yarn.

```shell
yarn add immutable
```

Then require it into any module.

<!-- runkit:activate -->

```js
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b') + ' vs. ' + map2.get('b'); // 2 vs. 50
```

### Browser

Immutable.js has no dependencies, which makes it predictable to include in a Browser.

It's highly recommended to use a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or
[browserify](https://browserify.org/). The `immutable` npm module works
without any additional consideration. All examples throughout the documentation
will assume use of this kind of tool.

Alternatively, Immutable.js may be directly included as a script tag. Download
or link to a CDN such as [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/immutable)
or [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/immutable).

Use a script tag to directly add `Immutable` to the global scope:

```html
<script src="immutable.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
  map1.
